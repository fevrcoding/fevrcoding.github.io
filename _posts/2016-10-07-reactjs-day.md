React is an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces that aims to address challenges encountered
in developing single-page applications.

After a successful 2015 conference with over 200 atteendees, ReactJS Day is back!
A full-day conference in english about the latest developments in the React world will take place on
October 7, 2016 in the lovely city of Verona, Italy.

Great speakers will talk about reactive/rx programming, performance, graphql vs falcor, immutable, universal,
flow, jest/ava/tape/mocha testing, native android/win... and perhaps about javascript fatigue and semicolons ;-)
